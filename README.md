# FirstApp-Lemon :fire:
##### Hola there :wave:, this is a simple android app that demonstrates clean architecture in android with a set of handful libraries
###### Libraries used :thinking:
	* Retrofit for networking (from jsonplaceholder rest api)
	* RXJava for handling threading and dealing with the network calls
	* Dagger 2 for dependency injection
and MVP as a design pattern

It's a simple app that applies the four REST API methods (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and integrates them in this simple app
